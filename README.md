# Additional materials for VSS poster presentation, May 2023
Thank you for taking the time to view our poster and for following the links to the supplementary materials.
Below you can find additional details about how the multi-view spaces were constructed, and videos of reconstructions across views using these spaces, and videos depicting what the components of the PCA spaces look like. 


## Methods
### Warping
### Model construction
#### Model 1 - multi-view, simultaneous entry
#### Model 2 - separate spaces
#### Model 3 - multi-view, paired entry
### Reconstructing frames
#### Model 1 - multi-view, simultaneous entry
#### Model 2 - separate spaces
#### Model 3 - multi-view, paired entry
