## PCA space demonstrations
These animations depict the first 3 dimension of a face space constructed using principal component analysis (PCA). At the centre of space is the average face. Scaling along each of the components we can see how the face changes in shape and texture from average, with increasing distance from the average magnifying this difference. The ‘high_caric’ version shows how faces can become heavily caricatured simply by increasing the scaling factor applied to the weights on each component.
